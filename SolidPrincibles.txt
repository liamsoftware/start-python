Single responsibility - classes and methods should have a single job.
Open for extension, closed for change - classes are closed for change, but can be subclasses and extended.
Liskov substitution - objects of the same type (or subtype) can be changed without causing disruption to the program.
Interface separation - interfaces should be small to make it easy for classes to implement only what they need.
Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions) - depend on abstractions and interfaces as opposed to concrete classes.
